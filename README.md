What is WellCommerce?
-----------------

WellCommerce is an e-commerce platform for PHP 5.4+. It can be used to develop all kind of shops and extend them in the way you like.

WellCommerce code is still hot but it only gets cooler :). Here are most important things which we have used to create this solution:

- Symfony2 components as a base for customized application core
- Eloquent taken from Laravel framework as base ORM
- Codeception for BDD testing
- Twig as templating engine
- Twitter Bootstrap 3 as a base HTML framework

Although WellCommerce does not use Symfony2 Full-stack, every Symfony developer should feel here like home.
