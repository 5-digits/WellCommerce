What is WellCommerce?
---------------------

WellCommerce is an e-commerce platform for PHP 5.4+. It can be used to develop all kind of shops and extend them in the way you like.

The code is still hot but it only gets cooler :). Here are most important things which we have used to create this solution:

- Symfony2 components as a solid foundation of application core
  - Config
  - Console
  - Debug
  - DependencyInjection
  - ExpressionLanguage
  - EventDispatcher
  - Filesystem
  - Finder
  - HttpFoundation
  - HttpKernel
  - Intl
  - OptionsResolver
  - Process
  - PropertyAccess
  - Routing
  - Serializer
  - Stopwatch
  - Translation
  - Twig Bridge
  - Validator
  - Yaml
- Eloquent taken from Laravel framework as base ORM
- Codeception for BDD testing
- Twig as templating engine
- Assetic for asset management
- Twitter Bootstrap 3 as a base HTML framework
- ZF2 Cache component

Although WellCommerce does not use Symfony2 Full-Stack framework, every Symfony developer should feel here like home.
