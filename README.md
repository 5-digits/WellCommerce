What is WellCommerce?
---------------------

WellCommerce is an e-commerce platform for PHP 5.4+. It can be used to develop all kind of shops and extend them in the way you like.

The code is still hot but it only gets cooler :). Here are most important things which we have used to create this solution:

- Symfony2 Full-stack framework
- Eloquent taken from Laravel framework as base ORM
- Codeception for BDD testing
- Twig as templating engine
- Assetic for asset management
- Twitter Bootstrap 3 as a base HTML framework
- ZF2 Cache component
